# Bandwidth Monitor

- Type of Challenge: `Verify Coding Knowledge` 
- Duration: `1/2 day`
- Challenge Type : `Team - Continue with same team as the previous challenge`-

Build a shell script that monitors network bandwidth usage on a system. It will track data sent and received through a specific network interface over a period of time, then display the results or log them to a file. 

## Features
1. Monitor traffic for a given network interface (e.g., eth0 or wlan0....).
2. Calculate data transmitted and received over a defined interval (e.g., every 5 minute).
3. Provide total bandwidth usage in bytes or kilobytes over time.
4. Log this data and provide average, maximum, and minimum usage.
